# Contributing to Cancer Complexity Toolkit Workflow

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Cancer Complexity Toolkit Workflow as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
We use Nextflow for workflow management. Make sure you have Nextflow installed and are familiar with its syntax before contributing.

## Development Process
We use the `main` branch as the primary development branch. All changes should be made through pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/cckp-toolkit-workflow/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/cckp-toolkit-workflow/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Keep line length under 100 characters
* Follow the Nextflow style guide for workflow files
* Use meaningful variable names
* Add comments for complex logic
